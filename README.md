### About
You decided to take a break from all the fuzz in town. Camping trip might help you relax a bit.
And yet, while you were calmly camping and chilling you hear something unusual...

#### Known imperfections
- no highscore list (just remember your score like your grandparents did)
- if you manage to somehow fall of the map, the game will restart and you will loose points (thats what you get for trying to jump away)
